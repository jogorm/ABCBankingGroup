# ABCBankingGroup
This project was done as part of my software engineering degree. 
The project was to create a service-oriented architecture of a bank system. 
This project is the mobile banking application, and it communicates with a WCF service running on Azure cloud. 
The application is created in Android Studio, and is my first Android application. 

This project is no longer active!
